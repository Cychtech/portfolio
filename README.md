    <p>Hello! I'm Chiwa N, and I'm a computer enthusiast based in Nairobi, Kenya. 
        Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by the potential of technology to create, solve problems, and connect people. 
        I'm a lifelong learner, constantly eager to expand my knowledge and build exciting things. 
        This portfolio is a testament to that journey!</p>

      <h2>How did I make this</h2>
      <p>I built this portfolio using the building block of the web HTML.  
          GitHub Pages provides a platform to host my portfolio, making it accessible to anyone who visits.</p>

          <li><h4>Web Development</h4>
            <ul><li><a href="https://massivegym.store" target="_blank">Massivegym Website</a></li>
                <p>This is my personal website built with HTML and CSS. 
                It serves as an online gym training services selling platform. 
                    You are able to select the gym plan you want to purchase and also offers a space to hire a gym trainer.</p>

            <ul><li><a href="">Mr Benson's Kiosk Profit Tracker App</a></li>
                <p>During fall semester last year, I developed a practical application called the Benson's Kiosk Management App. 
                    This project aimed to assist Mr. Benson, the owner of a small kiosk, in efficiently managing his business operations. Here is what the app does:</p>
                <li><h5>Features</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sales and Purchases Tracking
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>The app allows record for new daily sales and purchases. 
                                    Gives the capability to input the quantity and price of items sold and purchased</p></li>
                            <li><p>It computes the total sales and total purchases for each day, providing Mr. Benson with a clear overview of his business transactions.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Profit Calculation
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Based on the sales and purchase data, the app automatically calculates the daily profit. 
                                It subtracts the total purchase cost from the total sales revenue</p></li>
                            <li><p>Mr. Benson can quickly assess how well his kiosk is performing financially.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>File Storage for future Retrivals
                        <ul>
                            <li>The app maintains a digital record of daily transactions. 
                                Each day’s data is stored in a file</li>
                            <li>Mr. Benson can easily retrieve historical information whenever needed. 
                                Whether it’s for tax purposes or business analysis, the app ensures that crucial data is organized and accessible.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Note
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Program uses a command-line interface and stores file in form of a text file</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul></li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><h4>Other Practice</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>I have also done other simple practice projects in python, html,css,javascript, and c++. 
                        These serves the purpose of sharpening my coding skills.
